[Definitions – to appear as an on-screen overlay when the name is clicked anywhere in the survey]

Public Cloud Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is defined as a multi-tenant computing environment in which organizations access shared compute or storage resources on-demand from third-party service providers, paying on a pay-per-use basis. The cloud service provider is responsible for housing, running and maintaining equipment, and allocating resources among clients. The client supplies and manages applications. 

Hosted Private Cloud (sometimes called Virtual Cloud or Virtual Data Center) is defined as a single-tenant, virtualized hosted Infrastructure as a Service, in which server infrastructure is dedicated to each enterprise client, not shared among clients as in public cloud Infrastructure as a Service. 

Bare Metal Cloud, also called bare metal servers, is defined as a type of scalable, single-tenant hosted cloud Infrastructure as a Service in which server infrastructure is dedicated to each enterprise client. Unlike a Public or Hosted Private cloud, the provider configures servers without a hypervisor or virtualization platform.

A Multi-Cloud environment combines services and resources from more than one cloud service provider. Multi-cloud deployments may involve workload or platform integration via APIs. 

A Hybrid Cloud is defined as any combination of cloud, hosting and private data center resources that are managed and controlled as a single pool of resources to run a workload.  In a hybrid cloud, workloads generally can operate seamlessly across environments; for example, applications may burst across environments or workload components may be hosted in different environments.

Software as a Service (SaaS) is defined as a multi-tenant, hosted application that is accessed by users via their Internet browser. The provider manages the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, storage, as well as individual application capabilities and upgrades. Access and use of the software application is available on demand via subscription or pay-per-use.

Platform as a Service (PaaS) is defined as a set of tools and functions available from a cloud service provider to facilitate development and delivery of SaaS-based applications.  Some PaaS capabilities are available at no charge; others are charged based on usage.

Managed Cloud Application Services are defined as specific application workloads that are hosted, managed, and maintained by a third-party expert. The provider is responsible for configuring and managing the infrastructure to support the application, as well as offering a range of customized services that may be outcome-based.  

Managed Cloud Infrastructure Services are subscription-based services in which a third-party Managed Service Provider manages the businesses’ cloud virtual machines or “instances.”  Services may include deployment; configuration, and scaling of cloud instances; operating system upgrades; and cost optimization. 

Co-Location Services are defined as traditional data center services in which the enterprise tenant leases power, cooling, and space from a third-party data center provider. The tenant provides its own compute and storage infrastructure.  

Managed Hosting Services are defined as traditional data center services in which enterprises lease compute and storage resources that are hosted and managed by a third-party data center provider.  The provider procures and manages the infrastructure equipment, and the client is fully responsible for its applications.

On-Premises Traditional Data Center is defined as a data center configuration that does not use virtualization; i.e., each application resides on a physical server. 

On-Premises Hyperconverged Infrastructure is defined as hardware- or software-based an infrastructure solution that combines compute and storage in a single appliance.  

On-Premises Software Defined Data Center (SDDC) is defined as a data center in which multiple virtualized infrastructure components (server, network, storage) are orchestrated, to simplify workload deployment and scaling. 

On-Premises Private Cloud is defined as a data center configuration that utilizes cloud orchestration or enablement software to enable scalability, elasticity, and on-demand resources across data center resources.
